            <p>The ingredients showcased here are pulled from the Wizard World API, which contains information from the Harry Potter universe. </p>
            <p>Upon clicking an ingredient, the ingredient name is passed into an image search engine using the Imsea API.</p>
            <p>With that said, I have no control over the specific image returned, so click at your own risk.</p>
            <p>Some of the ingredients here may be disturbing for some individuals, so again... click at your own risk.</p>
